        Smallest batch size: 4

Filtered out 9947 genes where more than 0.05 of samples had fewer than 100 expected counts

 66 genes were marked as "report" but pass QC. Updating them to "allow"
         7449 gene(s) remain
        Looking for samples where more than 10% of the high-quality genes have fewer than 100 counts
         1 sample(s) marked as "use" had low quality and will be removed.
        In total, removed 1 low quality samples.
